<p>I'm a young, seasoned professional who has worked in various client services roles and over-exceed expectations with strong organizational skills, vast educational background, and ability to work well with people. Along my career journey, I have gained a bachelors in Health Science and a masters in Sport Management but have worked in industries that differed from those tracks. Seeing how the tech industry has evolved and created opportunities that fit my passions, my studies in Software Engineering is the next step in my career journey.</p>
